//! Bzip compression for Rust
//!
//! This library contains bindings to libbz2 to support bzip compression and
//! decompression for Rust. The streams offered in this library are primarily
//! found in the `reader` and `writer` modules. Both compressors and
//! decompressors are available in each module depending on what operation you
//! need.
//!
//! Access to the raw decompression/compression stream is also provided through
//! the `raw` module which has a much closer interface to libbz2.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use bzip2::Compression;
//! use bzip2::read::{BzEncoder, BzDecoder};
//!
//! // Round trip some bytes from a byte source, into a compressor, into a
//! // decompressor, and finally into a vector.
//! let data = "Hello, World!".as_bytes();
//! let compressor = BzEncoder::new(data, Compression::Best);
//! let mut decompressor = BzDecoder::new(compressor);
//!
//! let mut contents = String::new();
//! decompressor.read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(contents, "Hello, World!");
//! ```
